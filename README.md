# Fizzbuzz-in-multiple-languages
Implementing Fizzbuzz in multiple languages

Fizzbuzz is a counting game used to teach division.
The rules are as follows:

Count from 1 to 100
If the next number is a multiple of 3 enter "fizz"
If the next number is a multiple of 5 enter "buzz"
If the next number is a multiple of both 3 and 5 enter "fizzbuzz"
Else enter the number

For this project I will be writing code for fizzbuzz in multiple languages and additional rules may be added.

Languages done:
Python
C#
C++

Languages To do:
C
Java
Javascript
Haskell

Possible Languages:
Rust
Go
Swift

This is purely for funsies.
